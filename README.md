# Overview

This software is a simple, one function program that was created to demonstrate my familiarity with python and github, that I can create programs, and set up a repository on github, which can then be updated or distributed to other team members.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code to write the program and its built-in source control features to link it with the repository.

I used Python as the language for the software, using only the standard features/libraries, the most basic form of a function, and a single print statement.
